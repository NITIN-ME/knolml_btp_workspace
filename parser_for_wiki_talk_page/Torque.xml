-- PUSH AND PULL --

&quot;Just as a force is a push or a pull, a torque can be thought of as a twist.&quot;

This is not necessary: either you build a theory with just the term &quot;push&quot; or you build it with the term &quot;pull&quot;, not both in one. And why should torque be a twist? It´s simply a push or a pull in one direction caused (and the other way around, too)by pushs or pulls in two directions which are square to each other and also to the torque.

Removed &quot;Loosely speaking, torque is a measure of the turning force on an object such as a bolt or a [[flywheel]]. For example, pushing or pulling the handle of a wrench connected to a nut or bolt produces a torque (turning force) that loosens or tightens the nut or bolt.&quot; Potentially confusing example. For the example of tightening a bolt into a plate, the text implies that a force is created acting through the axis of the bolt which causes tightening into the plate. As far as I understand it, the wrench causes a rotation around an axis of the bolt and it is the spiraled groove itself that caused the bolt to move further into the plate. 
While it is very common practice to define torque as acting perpendicular to both the force applied and the distance from the rotation point, I think these examples may cause an incorrect assumption that there exists a force in the direction we define torque. Perhaps further clarification is needed when defining that torque is and the direction it acts in.  &lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/2A02:C7D:522B:2500:108:2E10:C99E:6647|2A02:C7D:522B:2500:108:2E10:C99E:6647]] ([[User talk:2A02:C7D:522B:2500:108:2E10:C99E:6647#top|talk]]) 22:24, 15 September 2017 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::Thank you. That is much clearer to me. Would a simple change of constant permit similar arithmetic to be used for a generic scientific conversion (i.e. with metric units)? [[User:Bobblewik|Bobblewik]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:Bobblewik|(talk)]] 10:38, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:::Can you please clarify the question?  Yes, simple change in constants typically will convert between different systems (e.g. metric and imperial).

::::In any units, power is proportional to torque times angular speed.  In SI units, power equals torque times angular speed.   Is that what you are asking?  What are those SI units which can make the constant equal to one? Watts for power, of course, and newton-meters for torque.  Now, how do you need to change those revolutions per second in the formula on the article page to make the 2&amp;pi; disappear?

Can anyone explain to me why a tutorial on unit conversion is meaningful in the context of the article? I dont see it as being contextually siginificant to this specific article. My suggestion is that a Unit Conversion article be linked here, and either the specific tutorial moved there or deleted. [[User:Chobi|Chobi]] 19:15, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

Torque and power are related physical quantities. Power = torque times angular speed (tau times omega)...In SI torque is in N*m, ang. speed is in rad (not unit)/s so its in 1/seconds. Therefore, torque is in N*m/s, which reduces to (N*m)/(s). Since newtons time meters can be taken as a dot product and produce the scalar quantity work (in J), we get power in J/s. Work per unit time is the definition of power, so a W (SI unit for power) is just a joule/second, which is metrically equivalent to torque times angular speed.

Unit conversion is one of the ways new concepts are introduced, as framing a &quot;new&quot; unit in terms of existing ones often help learners see the manipulations that the old concepts have undergone. In this case, it shows the relationship of torque to force (linear analogy) and the relationship to power, work and other scalar quantities. 

In my opinion, we should do it in ALL METRIC units. SI = easy to understand, especially for a science article.

[[User:Ed-it|Ed-it]] 23:59, 16 November 2006 (UTC)


Isn't the correct unit of torque really newton-metres per radian.  In order for this formula: 

    P = τω

(where P is power, τ is torque, ω is the angular velocity)

to work, the units of torque must be newton-metres per radian.  If it isn't, then the formula can't be true.  Newton metres time radians per second does not equal watts, it equals watt radians.  Newton metres is the unit of work and energy and not torque. Work and energy divided by the angle in radians is the torque.

Newton metres per radian times radians per second equals newton metres per second, which equals joules per second, which equals watts.  It only works out this way.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/68.109.207.203|68.109.207.203]] ([[User talk:68.109.207.203|talk]]) 21:10, 7 July 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==old units==
Sam said that torque is lbf·ft, not ft·lbf The sequence force·distance is used almost without exception in metric units, so that is a parallel. I am aware not aware of any reason for the sequence. The [http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/derived_units/2-2-2.html BIPM] seems to have a consistent sequence for units but I am not sure what the guideline is. Do we have any statistics on how often the foot unit is first or second? Google comes up with many for either sequence. Perhaps it doesn't really matter. I don't mind either way. [[User:Bobblewik|Bobblewik]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:Bobblewik|(talk)]] 17:22, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:The sequence distance-force was common in the old metric &quot;meter-kilograms&quot; and &quot;centimeter-kilograms&quot;, more common than &quot;kilogram-meters&quot;, the order common for energy. (I have a torque wrench in &quot;meter kilograms&quot;, for example.)  Google can find several of them as well.
:Both &quot;pound-feet&quot; (lbf·ft) and &quot;foot-pounds&quot; (ft·lbf) are in common use, as you discovered.  Some experts and style guides recommend the former to distinguish the units of torque from the units of energy/work, a different quantity.  See [http://www.sporttruck.com/techarticles/0312st_hp/ this], for example. But there is much less of a sense of generally accepted rules for the English units (or for the old metric units, for that matter) than there is with SI.

:I've written this up under units.  Thanks for the good questions!  [[User:Samw|Samw]] 21:59, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::Your link was bogus.  Neither it nor anything else on the [[BIPM]] site says anything about the units of torque.  
::Futhermore, there are sources recommending pound-feet rather than foot-pounds going back to before SI ever existed.  So your chronology was wrong there, too. [[User:Gene Nygaard|Gene Nygaard]] 22:30, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:::Sorry, I didn't notice the second table on that page.  Of course, they call it [[moment of force]] there, ratrher than [[torque]]&amp;mdash;do you take that as prescriptive as well?
:::Here's what they say:
::::&quot;A derived unit can often be expressed in different ways by combining the names of base units with special names for derived units. This, however, is an algebraic freedom to be governed by common-sense physical considerations. Joule, for example, may formally be written newton metre, or even kilogram metre squared per second squared, but in a given situation some forms may be more helpful than others.
::::&quot;In practice, with certain quantities preference is given to the use of certain special unit names, or combinations of unit names, in order to facilitate the distinction between different quantities having the same dimension. For example, the SI unit of frequency is designated the hertz, rather than the reciprocal second, and the SI unit of angular velocity is designated the radian per second rather than the reciprocal second (in this case retaining the word radian emphasizes that angular velocity is equal to 2pi times the rotational frequency). Similarly the SI unit of moment of force is designated the newton metre rather than the joule.&quot;
:::So we can probably add something along those lines in the first paragraph of that subsection.

:::Now let's deal with the silly notion that the order of terms in English units should be determined by the order of terms in SI units.  That's nonsense.
:::As I pointed out above, and as you can determine for yourself by searching the internet with your favorite search engine, when kilograms-force are used, the &quot;meter-kilogams&quot; order is more common than the &quot;kilogram-meters&quot; order (perhaps in part due to he tendency of people to be sloppy in the separation of their units of measure, as can be seen on all the Wikipedia pages still using &quot;Nm&quot; as a symbol for newton-meters, and due to the fact that before SI, &quot;gm&quot; was an acceptable symbol for grams, there would be ambiguity that would need to be resolved if kilogram-meters were used.  Is &quot;kgm&quot; the symbol for kilograms, or for kilograms multiplied by meters&amp;that's the question people would have to ask.
:::As I claimed above, the idea that we should distinguish the English units of torque from the English units of energy and work far predates the International System of Units, which was only introduced in 1960.  I have found a clear example:
::::A.M. Worthington, ''Dynamics of Rotation: An Elementary Introduction of Rigid Dynamics,'' London, New York, Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras: Longmans, Green, and Co., 1920., p. 9.
::::&quot;'''British Absolute Unit of Torque.&amp;ndash;'''Since in the British absolute system, in which the lb. is chosen as the unit of mass, the foot as unit of length, and the second as unit of time, the unit of force is the poundal, it is reasonable and is agreed that the British absolute unit of torque shall be that of a poundal acting at a distance of 1 foot, or (what is the same thing, as regards turning) a couple of which the force is one poundal and the arm one foot.  This we shall call a poundal-foot, thereby distinguishing it from the foot-poundal, which is the British absolute unit of work.
::::&quot;'''Gravitation or Engineer’s British Unit of Torque.&amp;ndash;'''In the Gravitation or Engineer’s system in this country, which starts with the foot and second as units of length and time, and the pound pull (i.e. the earth’s pull on the standard lb.) as unit of force, the unit of torque is that of a couple of which each force is 1 pound and the arm 1 foot.  This may be called the ‘pound-foot.’&quot;
:::Nonetheless, there is no clear standard for English units today.
:::BTW, Worthington, who named the &quot;slug&quot; as a unit of mass in an earlier (1904) edition of this book (which may well have contained much of the same information about torque), also had another bright idea:
::::&quot;In the interests of clear teaching, the convention (which I am glad to see has been adopted in America) has been adhered to throughout, of using the word ‘pound’ when a force is meant, and ‘lb.’ when a mass is meant, and I have ventured to give the name of a ‘slug’ to the British Engineer’s Unit of Mass, i.e. to the mass in which an acceleration of one foot-per-sec.-per-sec. is produced by a force of one pound.'
:::It's easy enough to see why that idea didn't catch on.  The people who use the mass units would like to have both a spelled out word and a symbol for them, as would the people who use the force units (and, of course, those are often the same people).  [[User:Gene Nygaard|Gene Nygaard]] 23:05, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::::Thanks for the great examples.  Of course it was silly of me to assume imperial conventions come from SI.  However, I stand by my assertion that  lbf-ft predominates over ft-lbf for whatever reason and I suspect that's why SI adopted N-m.

:::::I think that if you looked into it carefully, you would find significant differences in usage in different fields of activities, geography, etc.  More a matter of degree than of uniform usage in any particular domain.
:::::It is my impression that when it comes to automobile engine torque, the foot first versions predominate, pretty much everywhere (even as ft-libras and the like).  But you will find variations among different manufacturers, variations among different magazine editors, etc., and in large groups little consistency at all.  On Wikipedia, ft·lbf clearly predominates over lbf·ft in this context, but that is probably still true but not so overwhelming outside Wikipedia.

== Sine/Cosine ==

Here's a little blurb to lay the sine/cosine issue to rest:

First of all, the cosine term in the definition of torque listed on this page is NOT correct. Torque is a result of a vector cross product, that is:

T = r x F

The definition of a cross product in scalar form is the following:

T = (r)(F)[sin(theta)]

Theta is the angle between 'r' and 'F'; while the diagram on the page is correct in stating that the side in question is (F)[cos(theta)], that is not the correct quantity to use when determining torque. The REAL definition is above, and a proof is located in &lt;i&gt;Analytical Mechanics: Sixth Edition&lt;/i&gt; by Grant Fowles and George Cassiday, on pages 15-16. In order to use the angle theta as defined in the picture, the correct equation would have to be:

T = (r) (F) {[1-((cos^2)(90-theta))]^(1/2)}

This is true for all cross products. The angle in question is ALWAYS the angle between the two vectors. The presence of a cosine term in the multiplication of two vectors implies a dot product, rather than a cross product.

FYI, the 'Anon' making the edits has a BA in Physics from the University of Maine, and I'm not too far behind; I'm currently finishing up my senior year in Physics at UMaine.

== To Sine or not Cosine, that is the question... ==

After being the 'Anon' following this page, I have decided to make myself known.

Torque can be confusing and complicated. The definition is given as a foreign thing called a &quot;cross product&quot;, which can easily be confused with simple multiplication because of the symbols invovled. The basic equation of a cross product is:

&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt; = &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; &lt;math&gt; \times &lt;/math&gt; &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; = &lt;b&gt;AB&lt;/b&gt;sin&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;

For a more in-depth discussion on cross products, see [[cross product]]

While it is correct to say that the side labeled as '(&lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt;)cos&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; ' is of that magnitude with the angle defined as it is, the angle cannont be defined as it is because that is not the definition of a cross product. Rather, the angle is defined for us as the angle made by the two vectors (in general, the angle between vectors &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;).

The only reason that I have for putting up this fight over something that seems so trivial is that, as a physicist, I like to see physics things done correctly, to avoid confusion on the part of all people reading the article, from high school students reading this for a refresher before a test, to non-science people searching to expand their knowledge base.

:Sorry, I'm at work at the moment and don't have time to go over your post in detail, though I certainly will when I've got a moment. Here's my reasoning for using the cosine.
:#The ''magnitude'' of the torque (no vector quantities here) is simply the magnitude of the force (at a perpendicular to the lever arm) times the length of the lever arm.
:#The magnitude of the force, that is, the component of the force in the direction perpendicular to the lever arm, is (in this particular problem), the cosine of |&lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt;|.
:#Put it all together, and you get Tq=(|&lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt;|&amp;sdot;cos &amp;theta;)&amp;sdot;|&lt;b&gt;r&lt;/b&gt;|. (Argh... I really do need to learn how to use those &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags sometime.)

I understand your reasoning for using the cosine now that you have explained it better. However, you are still misleading the reader with the way it is stated right now. If you are going to use this arguement, you should include this in your section, and remove the statement &quot;from the definition of cross product&quot;, as you are not using the definition of cross products, but the definition of torque. Otherwise, the sine arguement is the correct one, and the phrase &quot;from the definition of cross product&quot; can remain. Also, if you use the cosine arguement, you need to state that the term &lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt;cos&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is true only for this situation, as situations occur where sine is the appropriate term.&lt;br/&gt;

It may be more appropriate, also, to call the angle another name rather than &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, such as &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is used to denote the angle between &lt;b&gt;r&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt;, and is generally the angle given in problems, rather than the angle from the perpendicular. &lt;br/&gt;

Does this make sense?&lt;br/&gt;

:For those having trouble with these sorts of trig issues, try defining your axis system so that the X-axis lies along the moment arm. This elimiates one of the components of the moment vector (since the component of the foce along the new x-axis produces no moment), and makes evaluation of the cross product simpler. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[Special:Contributions/131.202.212.37|131.202.212.37]] ([[User talk:131.202.212.37|talk]]) 03:25, 20 March 2007 (UTC).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- HagermanBot Auto-Unsigned --&gt;

== Confused with relationship bet. torque n speed. ==


Well, this may sound lik a foolish question for some of u, but please clarify my doubt.

If torque is da driving force, then increasin it shld(according to me) increase the speed.
But how come the charactersitics of many motors exhibit a inverse relation to that, i.e how come torque is inversely proportional to speed.....

:I'm not too familiar with that... here's my bet though.  ENGINE speed should increase with torque, but not necessarily the vehicle speed.  In a common 5-speed transmission, at higher speeds you use upper gears, which necessarily have less torque. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[Special:Contributions/204.220.135.214|204.220.135.214]] ([[User talk:204.220.135.214|talk]]) 14:59, 5 April 2007 (UTC).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- HagermanBot Auto-Unsigned --&gt;

== Cross product vs. scalar multiplication ==

I find it very confusing that the same symbol &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; is used for both cross product and multiplication of two scalars, as in &lt;math&gt;a \times b&lt;/math&gt;. I've never seen this symbol used for multiplication (except maybe in elementary school). Usually, the product of two scalars &lt;math&gt;a\ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b\ &lt;/math&gt; is written as &lt;math&gt;a \cdot b&lt;/math&gt; or simply &lt;math&gt;a\ b&lt;/math&gt;. 

The problem could be that the symbol &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; is called \times in TeX, and someone took this too literally?

:You get confused too easily. Why is it okay to use the dot for scalar multiplication but not the cross? Wouldn't you instead get confused with the dot product?

== Proposed Phrase ==


&quot;Do as I torque, not as I talk!&quot;

&quot;Do as I do, not as I say!&quot;.

== Torque defined about a point not axis ==

The definition of angular momentum and torque on their respective pages must be consistent. Angular momentum is defined about a point with r x p and r being the distance from the point; torque is defined about an axis with r x F and r being the distance from the axis. Someone please change the torque definition. I've only just come across defining angular quantities about a point for the first time so I wouldn't feel happy making the changes myself.

:The [[Torque#Definition and relation to angular momentum]] section now starts with the sentence &quot;Torque is defined about a point, not specifically about an axis as mentioned in several books.&quot;. Those several books have a good reason for defining a torque about an axis. In general a torque is about a point, but in many cases only one component is important and it is then both easier and more usefull to talk about the torque around an axis. In many practical cases (e.g. the torque produced by a motor, or that used to tighten a bolt) the axis to use is obvious, but choosing a single point is not as easy and it will give you a torque vector when you are only interested in the magnitude. I think that the definition section (and the lead) should contain both the general definition and the practical one (about an axis), starting with the practical one since readers not familiar with vector algebra will stop reading when they find a cross product.

::That line was added by an IP back in 2010 [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Torque&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=389744476]. It seems confused and misleading to me. Any instantaneous rotation will be around an axis so even if you have a situation where you might possibly have multiple posible direction of rotations, say a joystick, as soon as you apply a force you have a axis.

*'''Oppose''' merger, unless it is in opposite direction, with the merger to the [[Torque]] article.  According to [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions]], it should be at the most common name in English.  Furthermore, they are ''not'' the same.  If the articles are not merged, [[Moment (physics)]] should be moved to [[Moment of force]] for disambiguation purposes. And, why in the hell is [[Moment of force]] a redlink now anyway? There are other &quot;moments&quot; such as [[moment of inertia]].  [[User:Gene Nygaard|Gene Nygaard]] 10:01, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' - there's still some historical differences that could be explored in different articles. [[User:James.Spudeman|James.Spudeman]] 23:35, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''. The context in which torque and moment are used is quite different.  ''Torque'' is used when calculating the mechanics of a shaft.  ''Moment'' is used in statics, e.g. there is a moment in the [[cantilever beam]] due to a force on the end of the beam. I think the difference relates to long axis vs. short axis-- or obvious rotational axis vs. non-obvious axis.  A few other opinions are [http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070202002507AA9rPws here]-- they also dispute that they are the same.

== Removed text ==

I removed the following recently added text:

:In the motor sports community it is a widely held misconception that the torque rating of a motor is an indication of how rapidly it will be able to accelerate a vehicle. Acceleration is work, and as such requires the application of force over distance (the definition of power). Horsepower or watts provide the indication of the power-producing capability of a motor.

First, acceleration is not work and force over distance is not the definition of power (it is the definition of work) and second, while horsepower is important for top speed, it ''is'' torque that determines acceleration.  Consider the case of an electric powered vehicle at rest.  At the moment that the vehicle begins to accelerate, the horsepower generated by the motor (no matter how powerful it is) is exactly zero.  [[User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]] 02:41, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

:The argument is in general pointless; you can successfully argue that either torque or horsepower determine acceleration. The fact is that with a rotational system providing energy that is translated into linear motion, torque and power are functions of the other; increase one, and you increase the other by the same amount on a percentage basis.

:Then you get the arguments about where you want to be on the powerband for maximum acceleration.  For a given gear ratio, maximum acceleration is at peak torque, which also maximizes P/v. For a given speed, choose the gear ratio that places you at maximum power.  This also maximizes torque at the wheel.

:That being said, any sort of power vs. torque discussion probably doesn't belong on Wikipedia. It's a physics system of equations problem that just confuses those who don't have a fairly decent grasp on physics. [[User:Marimvibe|Marimvibe]] 20:21, 22 April 2007 (UTC)

Given a constant torque, the angular acceleration is constant (assuming the moment of inertia is constant).  Yet, the power can be negative, positive or even (instantaneously) zero.  Thus, I dispute that one can successfully argue that power determines acceleration.  [[User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]] 21:27, 22 April 2007 (UTC)

:Power=Torque X Angular Speed for a rotating system. It's a fact. See: [[Torque#Relationship_between_torque.2C_power_and_energy]] for reference. The two are inseperable. In fact, it's easier to calculate acceleration from power than from torque at a given speed, as Force=Power/Velocity, whereas going from torque you need to go through two gear ratios and the moment arm on the tire to obtain the force on the vehicle. [[User:Marimvibe|Marimvibe]] 23:34, 22 April 2007 (UTC)

That &lt;math&gt;P = \tau*\omega&lt;/math&gt; is well known and further, irrelevant to what I've said above.  Don't you understand this?  Ask yourself the following question:  If all I know is torque and moment of inertia, can I find the angular acceleration?  Answer:  '''yes'''.  Follow-up question:  If all you know is the power and moment of inertia, can you find the angular acceleration?  Answer:  '''no'''.  One ''must'' also know the angular speed.  But, what is angular speed?  That's right, it's the time integral of angular ''acceleration''.  But wait, if power is proportional to the time integral of acceleration, then ''power cannot be used to determine acceleration without the history of the acceleration being known''.  Don't you see this? [[User:Alfred Centauri|Alfred Centauri]] 00:00, 23 April 2007 (UTC)

:If you know torque and rotational speed, you know power, and vice versa. They define each other. Good luck trying to do anything involving conservation of energy with only torque. In any case, your argument doesn't even speak to the section that was removed. As far as whether a car with high horsepower or high torque will be quicker, the car with high horsepower will be quicker, assuming independant gearing for each car. It just won't be as driveable, seeing as how the engine will need to be operated at a higher speed. For example, compare the RX-8 to a '99-'02 Cougar (own one, don't need to look up stats for it.) Both weigh about 3050 lbs. The Cougar produces 165 ft-lb, the RX-8 160. But the RX-8 has 230hp, the Cougar 170hp, about 35% more. And the Cougar takes ~8 seconds to get to 60, the RX-8 ~6, ~33% quicker. Same weight, slightly less torque, ~30% more power, ~30% quicker.  So what's more important? [[User:Marimvibe|Marimvibe]] 02:29, 23 April 2007 (UTC)

My friend, your statement that &quot;[power and torque] define each other&quot; is nonsense.  The rotational speed ''is not a proportionality constant''.  If there is a torque, then there is an angular acceleration and if there is an angular acceleration, the angular speed is changing with time.  What you have here is a ''differential equation'', not a ''definition''.  To see this, consider what I said above in the language of the calculus instead of words:

&lt;math&gt;\alpha(t) = \frac{\tau(t)}{I}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P(t) = \tau(t) \omega(t) = I \alpha(t) \left (\int_{0}^{t} \alpha(r)\, dr + \omega(0) \right ) = \tau(t) \left (\int_{0}^{t} \frac{\tau(r)}{I}\, dr + \omega(0) \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Any person reasonably familiar with calculus based physics will agree with the above equations which together say:

:(1) At any instant, angular acceleration is proportional to torque and

:(2) At any instant, angular acceleration is ''not'' proportional to power.

Finally, your statement &quot;Good luck trying to do anything involving conservation of energy with only torque&quot; seems strangely out of context and, more importantly, seems to contradict the very point you keep insisting on.  For if, as you claim, ''power and torque define each other'', why would a conservation of energy problem be more difficult with just torque?  Please think about that ...

== Change in the &quot;Relationship between torque, power and energy&quot; section. ==

i've changed the section &quot;Relationship between torque, power and energy&quot;
Power is just not the product of torque and angular velocity as was mentioned a little bluntly. it is the product of the torque and the change in the angular velocity produced due to its application. a rotor may have been rotating at about 1000 rpm before being applied with a torque of 50N-m. the resultant rpm (say 1200 and the corresponding angular velocity 1200*2pi/60) CANNOT be used to find the power transmitted to that rotor.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Sganesh 88|Sganesh 88]] ([[User talk:Sganesh 88|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sganesh 88|contribs]]) 13:51, 1 February 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:Power ''is'' just the product of torque and angular velocity (or of force and linear velocity). The torque is doing work even if the angular velocity does not change (e.g. if something is applying an equal torque in the opposite direction), and the work per unit time (power) depends only on the distance traveled per unit time (velocity) - not on whether the velocity is increasing or decreasing across that distance.

|Hi,

I'm a new user to Wikipedia but not a new 'consumer'. So I'm not sure if you are the correct person to send this message - if not, apologies.

I noticed in the Torque page an animated gif http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Torque_animation.gif

This diagram is inconsistent for the given equations of torque. The diagram describes a rotational constraint in one plane only. The equations describe torqe without constraint. The sinθ term in τ = rFsinθ is incosistent with the diagram. Imagine a force acting parallel to the turning axis. Because of the constraint, there would be no resultant rotation although sinθ=1. Although the equation is correct it does not correctly explain the resultant motion in the diagram.

I suggest either losing the diagram, adding a caveat or asking the author to address.

Thanks!

Quitequick is correct in that the illustration has a constraint which the formula doesn't have, as the ball's motion is limited by the hinge. However, this is no different from any classroom physics demonstrations. When you use an [[air track]], you have a similar limitation. Of course, a smart student might ask: &quot;But what happens if I push the cart sideways? According to the formula we learned, it  should move sideways, shouldn't it? The formula you taught us and the experiment are inconsistent!&quot;, to which I would reply &quot;You are correct. The reason we're using a constraint is to simplify reality. Please go along with me and, for the moment, just think in one dimension. Once you completely understand one dimension, you can much better understand three dimensions.&quot; Up until now, I thought that was understood with physics experiments, but it obviously isn't for everyone among our readers. Maybe someone has an idea how to word this in this article, so that Quitequick's concern is addressed? &amp;mdash; [[User:SebastianHelm|Sebastian]] 19:43, 12 December 2008 (UTC)

:I would disagree that the image is in any way inconsistent with the formula. The image simply illustrates one possible application of the formula, in which the applied force is perpendicular to both the arm and the axis. This is certainly a valid application of the formula, so no inconsistency here. If the applied force had had components parallel to the arm and/or the axis, then these components would have had no effect, because the mechanical constraints of this particular setup would have provided equal and opposite forces to cancel out the additional components, so we would have been back to having a ''resulting'' force identical to the one shown in the image, and again there would be no inconsistency with the formula. Certainly, there are other possible ways to illustrate the formula - even ones employing motion in more than 2 dimensions - but how much additional insight would they provide, and how easy would it be to grasp what was going on? Let's be honest, this 2-dimensional example is already quite complex for someone who doesn't already understand the concept. [[User:Yawe|Yawe]] ([[User talk:Yawe|talk]]) 23:21, 18 March 2009 (UTC)

The definition of torque is erroneous.  Torque is the action of a '''force couple'''; therefore, it reflects a state of force equilibrium.  On the other hand, a moment is not force equilibrated.  Consequently, the equivalent of a moment is a torque plus a force parallel to the force creating the moment that passes through the point the moment is taken about.

I would like to add another concern about the diagram. This concerns the way in which Torque (and Angular Momentum) are visualised. They are both represented by vertical arrows. This gives the impression that the things they refer to actually have a vertical character, which they don't. To my mind, it would be better if Torque and Angular Momentum were indicated separately.  [[User:Willbown|Willbown]] ([[User talk:Willbown|talk]]) 14:34, 10 November 2012 (UTC)

:The directions of the arrows are correct according to the right-hand rule. In some texts a moment of force (or torque) is differentiated from a force by putting a small circular arrow around the main arrow and in a plane normal to the arrow. This is very difficult to add to an animated GIF and there it is reasonable not to be included. Of course, there is another easier method, that of using different colours for each type of dimension. This is what the author of the GIF did and it is effective. The only problem with the GIF is that the force and torque are shown simultaneously. In fact only one, or the other, is needed to create the motion and momenta.  [[User:Dger|Dger]] ([[User talk:Dger|talk]]) 19:59, 10 November 2012 (UTC)

== Equations for moment arm formula is confusing ==

The equation for the special moment arm case is confusing. The formula uses a centering dot for the formula, which is also the vector symbol for the dot product. Torque is often expressed in vectors and so it is not obvious whether the centering dot is multiplication or a dot product.

Since the dot product of any perpendicular vectors (moment arm and force) is equal to 0, moment arm (dot) force is incorrect. I suggest the equation is rewritten without using symbols that suggest vector operations (x is also out, as it could mean cross product). Perhaps the equation could be written, simply &quot;|\tau| = (moment arm)force&quot;

Multiplication is implied by such use of the parenthesis.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/209.94.128.117|209.94.128.117]] ([[User talk:209.94.128.117|talk]]) 08:11, 2 February 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::OK; I think I finally noodled it out. When the force exerted on the lever is perpendicular to the lever (and in the plane of rotation), then the moment arm is equivalent to the distance from the pivot point to the point of force exertion, but if the force exerted on the lever is not perpendicular to the lever, then the moment arm becomes a line segment from the pivot point perpendicular to the (extension of the) force vector. If this understanding is correct, then perhaps we should include some wording like this in the text and also redo the diagram for clarity.

== Moment and Torque are NOT the same ==
I move to change this entire article from torque to moment, and create a subsection called torque, because a torque is a special case of a moment.

Moment, also known as the moment of force, is the &quot;rotational effect&quot; of a force on a body about a given point. A torque (or moment couple) is a special case of a moment, when forces applied to a body cause rotation but are equal and opposite (i.e., the resultant is zero). Hence, a moment is more general than a torque. Additionally, a torque can be applied anywhere on a body and is not necessarily associated with a point. Hence a moment arm cannot be associated with a torque. This explanation comes from ''Dynamics, Theory and Applications'' by T.R. Kane and D.A. Levinson, 1985, pp. 90-99: http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/handle/1813/638 [[User:Samner|Samner]] ([[User talk:Samner|talk]]) 17:25, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

:The definitions of &quot;torque&quot; and &quot;moment&quot; used by physicists is different than the ones used by mechanical engineers (like Kane and Levinson). In the physics definition, for example, it's not true that torque is a special case of moment.

:My own preference would be to keep the title, but have the first section of the article be &quot;Torque vs Moment&quot;.

Hey guys there may be a mistake here.  That's because the true definition of Torque is &quot;the rate of change of angular momentum&quot; - in other words, the angular momentum is accelerating.  Tau = dL/dt.  If the angular momentum is not accelerating, for example any scenario in statics, then that is properly called Moment.  Both are also called &quot;twisting force&quot;.  The diagrams with pivot point are all incomplete.  That's because it shows a force acting on the end of a body relative to the pivot, but it doesn't show the &quot;equal and opposite&quot; force being applied by the pivot onto the body.  So all pivot systems are also force-couple systems, its just that the diagrams here don't show the missing force.  Think of it, you apply a force to a body and by Newton's 2nd law it will accelerate in that direction, except for the action of the pivot.  What is the action of the pivot? It applies an equal and opposite force that causes the body to change its angular momentum, in other words, start to rotate.  What is it called when dL/dt is equal to zero?  That is a state of zero torque.  That's what happens on your truck driveshaft when you are driving at a constant speed.  The driveshaft is rotating with a constant speed therefore constant angular momentum therefore dL/dt = 0.  The twisting force in that driveshaft is therefore MOMENT.
Else we must delete tau = dL/dt because now you are saying sometimes torque means rate of change of angular momentum, and sometimes it means something else.  Which is it?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/12.148.70.200|12.148.70.200]] ([[User talk:12.148.70.200|talk]]) 18:27, 29 July 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:I think we should delete tau= dL/dt as a definition. Of course NET tau = dL/dt, but tau = r x F is true for the component taus and not just the total tau, so it's more general. Anyway stating one definition is simpler than stating two definitions, and tau=rxF is far more common in textbooks. We can have net tau = dL/dt as a &quot;theorem&quot; (something we demonstrate/prove) instead of a definition. Again, I believe this is the usual approach.
:If something is &quot;properly called moment&quot; than it is the proper subject of this article...the consensus is that this article is the wikipedia article on the concept that engineers call moment (despite the fact that this article is not called &quot;moment&quot;). (At least I think that's the consensus...it's definitely what I think!)

==Moment of force vs momentum==
Do these things mean the same, its not quite clear.

:No. For example, units don't match. Moment of force = r F (N.m or kg.m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) but linear momentum = m v (kg.m/s) or angular momentum = I ω (kg.m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s).

I don't believe one would say something like &quot;Basically force measures the difficulty to move something&quot; but that is the linear analog of the above which indeed sounds more like a description of friction.  Consider that, in the absence of friction, there is ''no'' difficulty to rotate something, only to change it's rate of rotation due to its moment of inertia.

== Terminology ==

&quot;&quot;&quot;
In mechanical engineering (unlike physics), the terms &quot;torque&quot; and &quot;moment&quot; are not interchangeable. &quot;Moment&quot; is the general term for the tendency of one or more applied forces to rotate an object about an axis (the concept which in physics is called torque).[3] &quot;Torque&quot; is a special case of this: If the applied force vectors add to zero (i.e., their &quot;resultant&quot; is zero), then the forces are called a &quot;couple&quot; and their moment is called a &quot;torque&quot;.[3]
&quot;&quot;&quot;

&quot;&quot;&quot;
A moment under torque may mean something as simple as a single coupled heartbeat driven from the atria down into the ventricles. Systole represents a force that drives blood around an axis anchored north and south. Computational study of a single [[Heartbeat]] has been studied for many years. &quot;&quot;&quot;


Well, that's not true. The absense of a resultant force doesn't automatically give a couple. 
Also, one can deduce from this explanation that a system of applied forces are only considered to induce a torque when the object on which these forces are applied is not accelerating in any other way than through rotation (which would mean that an engine in an accelerating car for example couldn't have any torque). That is, if it is given rotation at all (since this explanation doesn't imply that this is in fact the case). Torque without tendency for rotation just doesn't make any sense. This needs to be clarified or removed.

&quot;&quot;&quot;
For example, a rotational force down a shaft, such as a turning screw-driver, forms a couple, so the resulting moment is called a &quot;torque&quot;. By contrast, a lateral force on a beam produces a moment (called a bending moment), but since the net force is nonzero, this bending moment is not called a &quot;torque&quot;.

This article follows physics terminology by calling all moments by the term &quot;torque&quot;, whether or not they are associated with a couple.
&quot;&quot;&quot;

Why lateral force? Since there is clearly no picture or anything to describe the position of the beam, this just doesn't help the reader at all. Also, the author of this comment implies that the beam is accelerating (&quot;the net force is nonzero&quot;), and uses that as an argument to why the &quot;bending moment is not called a &quot;torque&quot;.&quot;. So in order for the moment to be a torque, the system to which the forces are applied can't accelerate? Just as in the first part of this section, this is an equally false statement.

A couple can be rewritten as a moment and v.v., so the example doesn't really explain anything. Either that, or it is very poorly explained.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/193.11.207.155|193.11.207.155]] ([[User talk:193.11.207.155|talk]]) 15:01, 11 April 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

There's a section at the bottom there on torque multipliers, implying that only gearboxes that use epicyclic gearing can multiply torque, and worse, that only those gearboxes supplied by prestigious PowerMaster company can multiply torque.  I'd say that the behaviour of torque through gearboxes would be an interesting section to elaborate: what is conserved through a gearbox, what is converted etc.

[[Torque]] → {{no redirect|1=Moment of force}} —

See [[Torque#Terminology]] for background. This article discusses the concept that is called &quot;torque&quot; in many(?) introductory (high school or college) physics courses, but called &quot;moment of force&quot; (or &quot;momont&quot; for short) in engineering. But &quot;torque&quot; means something different in engineering. The problem arises when, say, a mechanical engineer wants to learn about moment on wikipedia. They might miss this article, just looking at the title and thinking to themselves, &quot;This is the article on torque...I know what torque means, and that's not what I'm looking for!&quot;

Basically, &quot;torque&quot; is an ambiguous term, whereas &quot;moment of force&quot; is unambiguous. Therefore &quot;moment of force&quot; is a better article title. I did a quick google and google books search but couldn't figure out that way which term is used more often for this concept. My suspicion is that &quot;moment&quot; is more common, or perhaps &quot;moment&quot; and &quot;torque&quot; are similar. I doubt that &quot;torque&quot; is much more common. --[[User:Sbyrnes321|Steve]] ([[User talk:Sbyrnes321|talk]]) 04:17, 8 April 2011 (UTC)

*(Just to set my knowledge background from the get go, I'm an ME from the US.) From the standpoint of using the technically correct name, you are absolutely right, it should be [[moment of force]]. However, from the [[WP:COMMONNAMES]] standpoint, &quot;torque&quot; is far more common and understood. So I can see this going either way. The engineer in me wants to see it at [[moment of force]] though, so I'd advocate for that. [[User:Wizard191|Wizard191]] ([[User talk:Wizard191|talk]]) 14:44, 8 April 2011 (UTC)
*: When I took introductory physics, the terms were used almost interchangeably (unfortunately). The distinction for me was really first made in my intro course on mechanics of materials, where a torque more or less specifically referred to a moment which twisted an object, whereas a moment (of force) bends an object (that's a fairly simplistic look at it). I would also argue for this article to be renamed were there to be any action taken (see below also). That said, I'm not sure I see a problem with how the article is currently structured which would require us to split the information. The mathematics are the same (which are the important part); you're just taking the moment around a different point in the case of a torque as opposed to a moment (in engineering). --[[User:Izno|Izno]] ([[User talk:Izno|talk]]) 05:28, 9 April 2011 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''': As you said, &quot;torque&quot; is the term used in high school and college physics classes and is therefore going to be what most people are familiar with. I would guess that a very low percentage of people have taken engineering courses. Personally, I've taken physics classes in high school and three different universities and I had never heard of moment of force before reading this article. A possible concern though is where the information about the engineering version of torque can currently be found.

**'''Comment''' -- &quot;Torque&quot; is used in ''some'' high school and college physics classes (including mine), but not all: At least one person (apparently in the UK) edited the article to say that he/she learned it as &quot;moment&quot;. It's hard to figure out the fraction of each. Keep in mind, the common terminology could be different now than 30 years ago, and it could be different in the US than the UK, etc. For the last question, the engineering version of torque is discussed only at [[Couple (mechanics)]] as far as I know. :-) --[[User:Sbyrnes321|Steve]] ([[User talk:Sbyrnes321|talk]]) 20:12, 9 April 2011 (UTC)

*A comment and a conclusion in support of changing the article name: &quot;[http://www.google.com/#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;q=force+moment+-wiki&amp;aq=o&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=c875dd2b8adea15a force moment]&quot; seems to generate 5x more results than even &quot;[http://www.google.com/#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;q=torque+-wiki&amp;aq=o&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=c875dd2b8adea15a torque]&quot;, which suggests that [[WP:COMMON]] be applicable. YMMV when looking at the number of Google results, but I suspect a moment of force is the more common term in most applications.
*:Checking Google Books, there were far fewer references to &quot;moment of force&quot;, but the entirety on the first page were to the primary usage here. The entirety of &quot;torque&quot;'s first page results were related to one of the last definitions on this page, the &quot;machine torque&quot;. The first reference that was indicative of a physics usage was in a mechanical engineering book&amp;hellip;
*:Checking Google Scholar, &quot;moment of force&quot; fairs poorly at 6k results, &quot;moment force&quot; (without quotation marks) does not at 2.4M results, and &quot;torque&quot; follows with 2.0M results, which indicates that the more common usage for this subject matter is &quot;moment&quot;, at the very least. These multiple sets of results suggest that, indeed, &quot;moment of forcee&quot; would be a better name, but I think I would settle for moving the information here to [[Moment (physics)]], if anywhere (this would require a physical page move rather than a cut and paste, for preservation of article history). This would free up the page name for &quot;torque&quot; in the engineering or in the car senses; the latter seems more common (since I seem to be arguing that way). --[[User:Izno|Izno]] ([[User talk:Izno|talk]]) 15:55, 12 April 2011 (UTC)

*:::GBooks and GScholars are adding more evidence that &quot;torque&quot; is the more common term when used in the '''machine torque''' context (naturally, given the number of people infatuated with cars&amp;hellip;). This lends weight that &quot;torque&quot; the article should really be about torque in the context of cars; as that is more closely tied to the act of [[torsion]] than as a [[moment (physics)|(bending) moment]], that suggests that the article called &quot;torque&quot; should be about the moment developed to twist something, rather than about the more general moment, which supports the move request (not exactly; I think the information in this article would be better suited for an article titled [[moment (physics)]] than [[moment of force]]).

*'''Comments (by proposer)''' -- &quot;Moment of force&quot; is usually shortened to &quot;Moment&quot;, which explains why a &quot;Moment of force&quot; search would discover relatively little.

Actually I like &quot;moment (mechanics)&quot; even better than my original proposal, [[moment of force]]. So my ideal would be: (1) Put this article (plus the new content in [[moment (physics)]]) into [[moment (mechanics)]]; (2) Redirect [[moment (physics)]] there too (or else to the main disambiguation page, [[moment]]); (3) The [[torque]] page could either redirect to moment (mechanics), or be rewritten as a new article that emphasizes the narrower sense like machine torque and cars, but of course there would be liberal overlap and cross-referencing between the new torque article and the moment article. :-) --[[User:Sbyrnes321|Steve]] ([[User talk:Sbyrnes321|talk]]) 19:19, 12 April 2011 (UTC)

*'''Comment''': The term ''moment'' by itself is slightly ambiguous with the most common meaning probably being [[bending moment]] but it does depend on context with it also being used for ''moment of force''. There are quite a few moments in engineering such as: [[first moment]], [[second moment]], [[moment of inertia]], [[polar moment]], [[product moment of area]], etc.. I am a physicist that teaches 2 intro level engineering classes, so I am far from an expert. From a physicists point of view engineers seem to like to add the word 'moment' randomly to various semi-related topics. (The only worse word in engineering is 'modulus' which engineer's like tossing around like its a Frisbee.) Neither of my intro level engineering textbooks use the word ''torque'' as far as I recall but prefer ''moment of force''. If it is going to be moved it should be moved to [[moment of force]].  One problem with using ''torque'' is that many people will come looking for what it means with respect to the output of motors and engines.

As far as I can see, the 'proof' in section 3.1 is incorrect. We cannot assume that d'''r'''/dt is zero. The article says that '''r''' is the 'radius', but it is the entire radius (position) vector of the particle! But even if it were only the scalar 'radius', it would be an unnecessary assumption. Indeed, d'''r'''/dt is the velocity of the particle, and so produces the zero vector when crossed with the linear momentum. --[[User:Andreas Rejbrand|Andreas Rejbrand]] ([[User talk:Andreas Rejbrand|talk]]) 16:41, 22 June 2011 (UTC)

==Stuck on a basic free-body problem==

I have been through this and related pages, but have been unable to find the answer to the question: &quot;If you have a number of forces acting on different parts of a free-floating rigid body, how can you calculate the resultant rotation and translation?&quot;  This seems to me to be a fundamental generalised question in mechanics and I'm disappointed Wikipedia and I couldn't work it out together.  (The same problem but with a fixed axis of rotation, i.e. a pivot, is also interesting, but I think that is covered well.)

So far the best I have come up with is:

* For each force, calculate its torque and divide by moment of inertia (about centre of mass), and sum all these to get the total torque, and thereby rotational acceleration.
* Also sum all forces together to get linear acceleration.

This works in the case of balanced forces (translation only, or rotation only), but I feel it must be wrong when both translation and rotation occur, because in the sums above the same force is being used twice to add energy to the system.  If you can point out what I am missing, perhaps I can update the appropriate article to clarify this.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/82.32.31.166|82.32.31.166]] ([[User talk:82.32.31.166|talk]]) 05:50, 17 January 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Or, equivalently, you can divide each torque by moment of inertia to get a contribution to rotational acceleration, then add those up to get actual rotational acceleration.)

Thanks Steve.  My problem is more easily stated by considering a single plank of wood lying on a frictionless surface.  Pushing it in the middle will cause it to accelerate linearly but not rotate.  When pushing anywhere other than the centre, some rotation and some acceleration will occur.  So my question: How do we work out how much of each occurs?  (I am doubting whether my solution above is correct!)

If I understand correctly, the linear acceleration is always the same (for the same force).  Is that true?  What is counter-intuitive then is how the extra rotational energy enters the system - presumably it must be down to the force working over a longer time period and distance.  This explanation would satisfy me if someone knowledgeable can confirm it!

(This is actually for a game, which has a space-ship with boosters on it.  What seems wrong is that the same boosters firing for the same amount of time could add more or less energy to the ship.)

== Confusion ==

The last two paragraphs of the units section are contradictory:

:This is an example of the confusion caused by the use of traditional units that may be avoided with SI units because of the careful distinction in SI between force (in newtons) and mass (in kilograms).

:Sometimes one may see torque given units that do not dimensionally make sense. For example: gram centimetre. In these units, &quot;gram&quot; should be understood as the force given by the weight of 1 gram at the surface of the earth, i.e., 0.00980665 N. The surface of the earth is understood to have a standard acceleration of gravity (9.80665 m/s2).

If using &quot;pounds&quot; causes confusion, then &quot;gram&quot; must also do so. If the weight of a gram is to be &quot;understood&quot; then the same is true for &quot;pound.&quot;

IMO, a discussion of advantages of a unit systems (&quot;This is an example of the confusion caused by the use of traditional units that may be avoided with SI units ...&quot;) is unrelated to the physical phenomenon of torque, especially when SI units can be abused &amp; become equally bastardized.

== &quot;Lever arm&quot; ==

This article defines &quot;lever arm&quot; as the distance r from the center of rotation to the point of application of the force.
However, it is more common to define it as the perpendicular distance between the center of rotation and the line of force.
In other words, lever arm is  r sin θ,  not  r.

:Lever arm can be defined either way but it makes more sense to define it as the distance to the point of application as that is where the lever would be if there was a lever.

== &quot;Tendency&quot; to rotate ?? ==
This article uses the word &quot;tendency&quot; to define torque in the first sentence.  What does &quot;tendency&quot; mean in physics, math, or engineering?  Tendency is a term that is based on some  unknown probability that is greater than 0.5.  In this case, it is based on the distribution of mass in the rigid body, and other torques acting on it, which does not need to have a probability of greater than 0.5 of causing a rotation.  There is also a &quot;tendency&quot; to want to know the rotation contribution caused by a specific torque, but that human desire should not be part of the definition. [[User:Ywaz|Ywaz]] ([[User talk:Ywaz|talk]]) 13:07, 27 January 2013 (UTC)

'''Torque, moment or moment of force (see the terminology below), is the tendency of a force to rotate an object about an axis,[1] fulcrum, or pivot.''' Tendency may not be the right word, as an applied force will always rotate an object around an axis (excluding frictional resistance). Perhaps another description would be that torque is an extension of the concept of force to account for rotational motion. In this sense, torque has no &quot;physical&quot; meaning, rather it is only &quot;force&quot; that has physical meaning. However I don't know if this is actually correct. Perhaps yet another definition: torque is the effectiveness of a force in producing rotation motion, given the same force applied at a greater distance produces a greater angular acceleration. The problem is, torque is one of those things we've been taught how to use without really understanding what it is.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/58.173.113.116|58.173.113.116]] ([[User talk:58.173.113.116|talk]]) 10:09, 22 March 2014 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== UK relationship between torque and moment of a force ==

''This article follows US physics terminology by using the word torque. In the UK and in US mechanical engineering,[3] this is called moment of force[4] shortened usually to moment.

In US mechanical engineering, the term torque means 'the resultant moment of a Couple',[5] and (unlike in US physics), the terms torque and moment are not interchangeable. Torque is defined mathematically as the rate of change of angular momentum of an object.''


In UK physics, torque is defined mathematically as the rate of change of angular momentum of an object. It is the resultant of all the individual moments of forces. So in UK physics, torque and moment of a force are not interchageable because a body in rotational equilibrium can have several moments acting on it but cannot have a torque acting on it. This seems to match the US mechanical engineering use.

So maybe the second para. should read &quot;In US mechanical engineering, and in the UK, the term torque means 'the resultant moment of a Couple'...&quot;

I'm not sure whether UK mechanical engineering matches UK physics or whether UK mechanical engineering matches US physics, which is why I haven't edited the article. I think that a UK mechanical engineer would happily state that a torque was being applied to a driveshaft even if the driveshaft wasn't turning (because the torque wasn't big enough). Come to that, a UK physicist might well do the same, but they would always fall back on the definition &quot;rate of change of angular momentum&quot; if pressed

:I find the first paragraph of the section [[Torque#Terminology|Terminology]] to be ambiguous:
::&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;This article follows US physics terminology by using the word torque. In the UK and in US mechanical engineering,[3] this is called moment of force,[4] usually shortened to moment. In US mechanical engineering, the term torque means &quot;the resultant moment of a couple,&quot;[5] and (unlike in UK physics), the terms torque and moment are not interchangeable.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
:Main assertions I could infer are:
:* &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i&gt;'''From the first part''': &quot;This article follows US physics terminology by using the word torque. In the UK and in US mechanical engineering,[3] this is called moment of force, usually shortened to moment.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, the term '''torque''' in US physics terminology translates to the term '''moment of force''' (or simply '''moment''') in US mechanical engineering terminology and in the UK terminology (the whole UK, as &lt;u&gt;implied&lt;/u&gt;).
:* &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i&gt;'''From the second part''': &quot;In US mechanical engineering, the term torque means &quot;the resultant moment of a couple,&quot;[5] and (unlike in UK physics), the terms torque and moment are not interchangeable.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, in US mechanical engineering, '''torque''' and '''moment''' are &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; interchangeable. But, in UK physics, they are interchangeable. So, even though '''US_Physics/torque''' actually refers to '''UK/moment''', the two terms are still interchangeable in UK Physics (although not in the rest of the UK, as implied, when combined with the previous assertion).

:So, in short, I see a problem that needs to be fixed;
:* US_Physics: The terms '''torque''' and '''moment''' are interchangeable.
:* US_Mechanical_Engineering: The terms are &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; interchangeable.
:* UK_Physics: The terms are interchangeable (?)
:* UK: The terms are &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; interchangeable (?)

::I agree this is a mess. IMHO, having studied from US engineering texts, moment of force is the preferred term for a torque. In the UK and various US sources &quot;torque&quot; means the moment of force about the &quot;torsional axis&quot; of an object where forces act to rotate or attempt to rotate the object. No actual rotation is necessary. For example, a torque wrench may be used to test the static torsion on a nut or bolt. Whenever, rate of change of angular momentum is used the correct term should be &quot;resultant moment&quot; or &quot;resultant torque&quot; not simply torque. There can be many forces and consequently many torques acting on an object but it is only the resultant torque that is equal to the rate of change of angular momentum. This is called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_laws_of_motion#Euler.27s_second_law Euler's Second Law]. The reference to Kane and Levinson is to a old text (1985) that may not reflect current engineering practice. For example, they don't define a force couple the way that it is currently understood. See [[Couple (physics)]] for example. A couple is generally considered to be a moment of force or torque caused by one or many pairs of parallel forces of equal magnitudes and opposite directions. Such forces have a zero resultant force but a nonzero resultant moment of force. They produce or attempt to produce pure rotation of an object.

::: To be honest, my primary objection to those three sentences I wrote in blue up there was/is '''not''' lack of normative consistency, but rather lack of (paragraph's) self consistency. I think it is quite understandable that slightly different terminology may co-exit (without threatening scientific health); US mechanical engineering terminology calls it moment when there is no change in angular momentum and calls it torque when there is a change in angular momentum. On the other hand, US physics terminology considers the two terms to be synonymous in all cases. That's perfectly fine in my opinion (maybe even necessary). My point was that those three sentences cause ambiguity/contradiction '''within themselves''', which is arguably a more critical issue than establishing a normative consistency, which may not even be possible in short term perhaps.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/85.110.45.230|85.110.45.230]] ([[User talk:85.110.45.230|talk]]) 14:34, 1 November 2014 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:::::I understand and appreciate your concern, but please; there are 49 sections in this talk page(!), and the one belonging to the space we're currently populating, which is already over-populated as it is, is &quot;UK relationship between torque and moment of a force&quot;, and that's precisely why I wrote what I wrote under this section in the first place. I don't think anybody has time to read a (severely) over-populated talk page. This is another thing I keep seeing over and over in wikipedia; apparently sometimes we love filling pages so inefficiently.. and arguing in an infinite loop.

:::::You don't like &lt;math&gt;\tau=dL/dt&lt;/math&gt;? well, I checked out a few recent teaching materials from MIT and Berkeley, all of which includes that equality, which considers torque to be change in angular momentum, and honestly it is quite natural to me. This isn't US books vs. Soviet era Russian books, we are just talking about &quot;torque&quot;. The whole point of rotating gyrsocopes and the associated precession motion upon application of a torque perpendicular to the axis of rotation is the change of angular momentum, which is explained by this very equality everywhere I looked. Apart from the right or wrong perspective, it exists in very many respectable references. It is just that the article should be clear about UK's terminology; UK_Physics is okay with the terms being interchangeable, but other disciplines in UK are not? Because that's what article says currently, right?

:::::If a system interacts with its environment in the sense that there is an external torque on the system, the net external torque acting on the system is equal to the time rate of change of its angular momentum:

== Gyroscopic Torques ==

After the section discussing rotation about a fixed axis there should be something clarifying that the inertia tensor of a freely rotating body changes relative to the inertial frame as a function of time and therefore the torque includes the extra gyroscopic terms.

In a 3d inertial frame,
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\mathrm{net}} = I\boldsymbol{\alpha}+\boldsymbol{\omega} \times I\boldsymbol{\omega}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Formula and info to add==
* τ = r x F is also written as M = d x F
* M = d x F is also the same as W = s x F (the latter signifies labour = force x displacement; whereby labour is in Joule)&lt;br/&gt;
The latter hence also means that labour equals moment of force or simply that 1 Joule equals Newtonmeter

:Labour should be work in English.  No work and torque, or moment of force, are not the same thing even though their dimensions are equivalent.

== Misleading example at section [[Torque#Relationship_between_torque,_power,_and_energy|Relationship between torque, power, and energy]] ==

&lt;math&gt; P = \boldsymbol{\tau} \cdot \boldsymbol{\omega},&lt;/math&gt;

Below paragraph is used to provide a practical example of the above equality:
:&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;In practice, this relationship can be observed in power stations which are connected to a large electrical power [[Electrical grid|grid]]. In such an arrangement, the [[electrical generator|generator]]'s angular speed is fixed by the grid's [[frequency]], and the power output of the plant is determined by the torque applied to the generator's axis of rotation.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

However, the claim that the [[electric power|power output]] of a power plant generator is determined by the applied torque is false. For a given [[angular frequency]] such as 60 Hz, which is constant for a power plant as the paragraph emphasizes, the power output is determined by;
# The number of turns in the generator's winding that is subjected to a varying magnetic field due to rotational motion of the rotor within the stator
# The physical dimensions of the generator
#:&lt;small&gt;&lt;i&gt;two of which in turn determines the ultimate rate of change of magnetic field, which yields a certain amount of [[electromotive force]] (EMF), i.e. voltage, as explained by [[Faradays law]].&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
# The resistance of the conductor, which determines the current for a given voltage.
&lt;math&gt;P = VI&lt;/math&gt;

In an operating thermal power station, if the torque on the shaft that rotates the generator's rotor is changed, the angular frequency is directly changed as the rotor will rotate at either a higher or lower angular frequency as a result.

A completely misleading example; a thermal power plant generator receives mechanical power as input, which is typically supplied by a steam turbine, and it outputs electrical power. Although energy is converted among various forms in this process, it is a false claim that 'torque on the shaft determines power output'.

:Since I didn't receive any feedback, I went ahead and replaced the problematic example with a more appropriate one:

::&lt;small&gt;&lt;i&gt;In practice, this relationship can be observed in [[bicycle]]s: Bicycles are typically composed of two road wheels, front and rear gears (referred to as [[sprockets]]) meshing with a circular [[bicycle chain|chain]], and a [[derailleur gears|derailleur mechanism]] if the bicycle's transmission system allows multiple gear ratios to be used (i.e. [[Single-speed bicycle#Advantages_and_disadvantages_versus_multi-speed_bicycles|multi-speed bicycle]]), all of which attached to the [[bicycle frame|frame]]. [[Cyclist]], the person who rides the bicycle, provides the input power by turning pedals, thereby [[Crank_(mechanism)|cranking]] the front sprocket (commonly referred to as [[Crankset#Chainring|chainring]]). The input power provided by the cyclist is equal to the product of [[cadence (cycling)|cadence]] (i.e. the number of pedal revolutions per minute) and the [[torque]] on [[Axle|spindle]] of the bicycle's [[crankset]]. Bicycle's [[bicycle drivetrain systems|drivetrain]] transmits the input power to the road [[wheel]], which in turn conveys the received power to the road as the output power of the bicycle. Depending on the [[gear ratio]] of the bicycle, (torque,rpm)&lt;sub&gt;input&lt;/sub&gt; pair is converted to (torque,rpm)&lt;sub&gt;output&lt;/sub&gt; pair. By using larger rear gear, or by switching to a lower gear in multi-speed bicycles, [[angular frequency|angular speed]] of the road wheels is decreased while the torque is increased, product of which (i.e. power) does not change.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

== Force? ==

My feeling is that this article is confusing with regard to the notion of force.  I may be mistaken, but I don't believe a torque is a force.  However, the article uses terms like turning force, and never fully clarifies whether or not torque is a force.  The sense I get is that torque is a rotational projection of a force, which happens to have a rotational character.  &lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/75.139.254.117|75.139.254.117]] ([[User talk:75.139.254.117#top|talk]]) 16:26, 13 October 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

I mostly don't understand this comment, but I'll try to address it anyway. I have nothing against helping people solve dimensional analysis problems involving torque—I would say that it's a lower priority than conveying virtually any of the other information in this article—but whatever, fine, I'm not against it. But my proposed change will not stop anyone from solving dimensional analysis problems involving torque. One can do dimensional analysis with kg, m, s instead of M, L, T. Trust me, I do it all the time! And if a reader ''really'' wants to use M, L, and T for some reason, they only need enough physics knowledge to know that kg is a unit of mass, m is a unit of length, and s is a unit of time. That's really not asking much! Beyond that, see my original edit comment above.

::: There is a convention that, when discussing dimensional analysis, MLT are used as identifiers for the ''dimensions'', rather than the symbols for the conventional units. This is twofold: to avoid questions of magnitude (which have no place here - it's purely ''dimensional'' analysis); secondly to avoid problems of unfamiliar units and errors over interpreting their dimensions. I have no idea offhand (at least not a reliable one) what the dimensions of a [[slug (unit)|slug]], [[erg]], [[dyne]] or [[poundal]] are. Now if we operate in a sensible pure SI world, then this problem becomes a little theoretical. But in engineering, rather than science, and engineering which involves the US, it's still a very real one.

::::Do you think that there are a lot of readers of the article who are simultaneously (1) capable of using and applying dimensional analysis, (2) not familiar off-hand with the fact that kg is a unit of mass, that m is a unit of length, and that s is a unit of time? If so, can you talk a bit about who you think these readers are? High school students? Professionals? Physicists? Engineers? Nurses? Are you personally in this category? I mean, if I tell you, Andy, that torque can be written in SI base units as kg·m^2·s^-2, would you have trouble figuring out that the dimension of torque is M·L^2·T^-2?
::::Also, how many times in your life have you, Andy, pulled up this wikipedia article for the purpose of finding the dimension of torque in MLT?
::::My experience is that dimensional analysis comes in two flavors:
::::* &lt;u&gt;The extremely common type of dimensional analysis, which does not involve MLT,&lt;/u&gt; is things like factor-label method, e.g. figuring out that sqrt(1 btu / 1 slug) is 19 miles per hour. This is the kind of dimensional analysis that I do every day, and that every scientist I know does every day. The MLT decomposition is not helpful for that: it can tell you that sqrt(1 btu / 1 slug) has units of velocity, but not ''what'' velocity it is, which makes it pretty much useless for everyday physics and engineering calculations.
::::* &lt;u&gt;Applying the Buckingham Pi theorem&lt;/u&gt; is ''extemely'' rare in my experience. I can think of 2 times in my life that I have done so, outside of homework problems (and I guess arguably certain extremely simple cases where you do it in your head, like defining a &quot;dimensionaless length parameter&quot; by dividing one length by another length). And I have never seen anyone else apply the Buckingham Pi Theorem either, outside of homework problems. I think of it as a tool to be used in unusually strange and challenging physics problems. (For the record, the rare times I've used Buckingham Pi, I did so with kg,m,s instead of M,L,T.)
::::So that's why (1) I see the MLT decomposition as useful to very small niche audience in the first place, and (2) those very few readers who do want to know the MLT decomposition are all people who are very capable of figuring it out themselves if given a kg,m,s SI base unit decomposition.

== Units for L=I&amp;omega; ==

We just had a long discussion about this, summarized at [[Talk:Angular_momentum#Bottom_line]]. In short, for the equation ''L=I&amp;omega;'', units of ''L'' must equal the product of the units of ''I'' and ''&amp;omega;''. ''I'' has units of ''ML&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' (mass times length squared), so any angular units in &amp;omega; must match the angular units in ''L''. I would prefer that ''L'' be expressed in ''ML&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;theta;/T'' (mass times length squared times angle per unit time) and that angular velocity be expressed in ''&amp;theta;/T'', in which case you would be right, the ''L=I&amp;omega;'' equation would be independent of angular units, as long as the angular units of ''L'' and ''&amp;omega;'' were consistent.

However, the [[International System of Units]] (SI) states that [[angular momentum]] (''L'') has units of ''ML&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/T'' and [[angular velocity]] (&amp;omega;) has units of ''1/T'', which is actually dimensionless radians per unit time. These are the units used in the respective articles. Unit-wise this is formally correct, but it requires that the angular velocity in ''L=I&amp;omega;'' be expressed in dimensionless radians per unit time. Having Wikipedia out-of-synch with SI is not a good idea, it's better to follow SI and then link to [[orientational analysis]] which treats angle as a base unit rather than a &quot;dimensionless unit&quot; (an oxymoron in my opinion), thereby sorting out the mess, but orientational analysis is not presently  mainstream or commonly used and some might argue that its theoretical foundations need work. [[User:PAR|PAR]] ([[User talk:PAR|talk]]) 00:19, 19 May 2019 (UTC)

: Both torque and the equation ''L=I&amp;omega;'' are much older than SI, and they are independent of what units you use. The equation will still be correct if you measure the angular velocity in degrees per year as long as you keep track of your units. You are right that, if one wants to follow SI one should use units of radians/s, where the radians are dimensionless, but the article does not limit itself to the SI unit system. It is much more general than that. [[User:Ulflund|Ulflund]] ([[User talk:Ulflund|talk]]) 09:36, 19 May 2019 (UTC)
