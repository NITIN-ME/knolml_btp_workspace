Joule, for example, may formally be written newton metre, or even kilogram metre squared per second squared, but in a given situation some forms may be more helpful than others.::::&quot;In practice, with certain quantities preference is given to the use of certain special unit names, or combinations of unit names, in order to facilitate the distinction between different quantities having the same dimension. For example, the SI unit of frequency is designated the hertz, rather than the reciprocal second, and the SI unit of angular velocity is designated the radian per second rather than the reciprocal second (in this case retaining the word radian emphasizes that angular velocity is equal to 2pi times the rotational frequency). Similarly the SI unit of moment of force is designated the newton metre rather than the joule.&quot;:::So we can probably add something along those lines in the first paragraph of that subsection.:::Now let's deal with the silly notion that the order of terms in English units should be determined by the order of terms in SI units.

Is &quot;kgm&quot; the symbol for kilograms, or for kilograms multiplied by meters&amp;that's the question people would have to ask.:::As I claimed above, the idea that we should distinguish the English units of torque from the English units of energy and work far predates the International System of Units, which was only introduced in 1960.

This we shall call a poundal-foot, thereby distinguishing it from the foot-poundal, which is the British absolute unit of work.::::&quot;'''Gravitation or Engineer\u2019s British Unit of Torque.&amp;ndash;'''In the Gravitation or Engineer\u2019s system in this country, which starts with the foot and second as units of length and time, and the pound pull (i.e. the earth\u2019s pull on the standard lb.) as unit of force, the unit of torque is that of a couple of which each force is 1 pound and the arm 1 foot.  This may be called the \u2018pound-foot.\u2019&quot;:::Nonetheless, there is no clear standard for English units today.:::BTW, Worthington, who named the &quot;slug&quot; as a unit of mass in an earlier (1904) edition of this book (which may well have contained much of the same information about torque), also had another bright idea:::::&quot;In the interests of clear teaching, the convention (which I am glad to see has been adopted in America) has been adhered to throughout, of using the word \u2018pound\u2019 when a force is meant, and \u2018lb.\u2019 when a mass is meant, and I have ventured to give the name of a \u2018slug\u2019 to the British Engineer\u2019s Unit of Mass, i.e. to the mass in which an acceleration of one foot-per-sec.-per-sec. is produced by a force of one pound.':::It's easy enough to see why that idea didn't catch on.
