The '''July 2006 Westchester County tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

==Meteorological synopsis==
On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow, New York]] around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300&amp;nbsp;yd (274&amp;nbsp;m) wide&lt;ref name="Tornado2"/&gt; and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County.&lt;ref name="USAT"&gt;{{cite news| author=Jim Fitzgerald| date=2006-07-14| title=Weather Service confirms F-2 tornado roared through N.Y., Conn. on Wednesday| work=[[USA Today]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/storms/2006-07-14-ny-tornado-confirmed_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York&amp;ndash;[[Connecticut]] border.
